This repository contains a complete collection of materials for Projects 2 (Quantization) and 3 (Pruning) for the Yolo-V3 object detection network. The Yolo-V3 network evaluates accuracy using a mean average precission (mAP) with minimum intersection over union of 0.5, and evaluations through these two reports will be quantified as such.
